<h1>Pitch</h1>
<h2>Make presentations, fast.</h2>

<p>
	<em>Pitch</em> is for those of us who never prepare for a presentation until an hour before.
</p>

<p>
	With <em>Pitch</em>, simply write your presentation out quickly using markdown syntax and we'll make it look great.

<p>
	Use <code>---</code> to add a new slide.
